### Hi, this is Milkey! 👋
aka. mili-tan / mk-mili / xuan

🔰 I'm often a newbie and a continuous learner, working on creating more visual and easy-to-use tools that make many things easier! 

I am also a former domain broker, former ChinaSkills and WorldSkills competitor, welcome to talk with me randomly about related.

I am interested in distributed networks and privacy security, hope better Internet for everyone.
